# reducing_model_cobrapy
This repo shows a comparison of two FBA solutions obtained by using Cobrapy package. 
The first solution was generated with the extended model for Staphylococcus aureus network iYS854 (iYS854_version_2.json file). 
The second solution was generated by removing the metabolites that participate in no reactions or in one reaction.

The set of constraints for metabolic interchanges was obtained in:

Methods for Quantifying the Metabolic Boundary Fluxes of Cell Cultures in Large Cohorts by High-Resolution Hydrophilic Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry. Ryan A Groves, Maryam Mapar, Raied Aburashed, Luis F Ponce, Stephanie L Bishop, Thomas Rydzak, Marija Drikic, Dominique G Bihan, Hallgrimur Benediktsson, Fiona Clement, Daniel B Gregson, Ian A Lewis. Anal Chem. (2022)

Other interchange reaction fluxes were set to a small number to avoid inconsistencies.
