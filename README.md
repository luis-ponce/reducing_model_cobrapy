# reducing_model_cobrapy
This repo shows a comparison of two FBA solutions obtained by using Cobrapy package. 
The first solution was generated with the extended model for Staphylococcus aureus network iYS854 (iYS854_version_2.json file). 
The second solution was generated by removing the metabolites that participate in no reactions or in one reaction.
